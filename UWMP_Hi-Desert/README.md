#### My role:
1. Reviewed slides and information
2. Developed the idea, outline, and slides for our video. Edited slides and video

Goal: To synthesize information about our system (Hi-Desert Water District) and propose innovative strategies
embracing the One Water approach. To communicate ideas in a way that all community members and government officials 
could understand, regardless of education or background.

### CE 110: Water Systems of the Future

**Course introduction:** 

*Taken from the course website*. The water and wastewater systems that serve human populations are
diverse, complex, expensive, and have long lifetimes. The infrastructure (reservoirs, canals,
pipe networks, treatment plants) also has significant impacts on the environment (modification
of ecosystems, energy and materials use, greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient cycles). An
interdisciplinary understanding is needed to design and manage these systems to provide
equitable and affordable access while meeting the needs of urban, agriculture, and energy
systems in the face of challenges from population growth and environmental change. US water
systems need major investments, while in many parts of the world adequate infrastructure has
not yet been built. This context presents exciting opportunities to integrate innovative
technologies, institutional arrangements, policies, and financial structures. What should water
systems of the future look like? To address this question from an interdisciplinary perspective,
this course will explore key scientific, technical, environmental, economic, political, and social
aspects of water systems.

Specific objectives for the course are:
1. Provide overview of the complex infrastructure systems that supply and manage water
and wastewater.
2. Introduce the technologies that are currently in use for treating and managing water and
wastewater, as well as innovations that have the potential to dramatically change water
infrastructure.
3. Explore the innovation ecosystem in the water sector, its opportunities and challenges,
and analyze case studies.
4. Provide overview and examples of concepts and methods for analyzing the sustainability
of water systems.
5. Consider costs and tradeoffs in water supply planning under uncertainty for real-world
water systems.
6. Critically evaluate water planning and innovation potential for real-world utilities given
future uncertainties and competing priorities
