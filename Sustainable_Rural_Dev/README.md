# Perspectives for Sustainable Rural Development in Latin America
*Assignments for a UC Berkeley course*

### In this folder:
* A table I co-created for a group presentation on "Rurally Based Social Movements and Peasant Organizations in Latin America"
* Brief essays I wrote that gave my perspective on:
  * Sep 18: Climate change will affect agricultural production; the question is, can we design a resilient food production system, and what form would it take?
  * Sep 30: What are the root causes of the global food crisis? How does the crisis manifest in Latin American countries?

**Course Overview:**

*Taken from course website*. This course analyzes the ecological, socio-economic and policy challenges and opportunities facing the rural 
population of Latin America in today’s globalized economy. After a critique of the impacts of conventional, 
agro-export development models of agricultural development (green revolution, non-traditional export crops, 
biotechnology, biofuels, etc.) the elements of a sustainable agroecological development path are discussed, 
a path that emphasizes farmers’ empowerment, local production for food sovereignty, poverty reduction, cultural 
identity and natural resource and biodiversity conservation. Technical, institutional, policy and market requirements 
for a sustainable and resilient agriculture are also analyzed in detail, particularly under the aftermath of the COVID19 pandemic.
